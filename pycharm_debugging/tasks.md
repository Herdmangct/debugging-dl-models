## Exercise 1

- Get your script to run without throwing exceptions.
- Modify train.py to see tensorboard output, don't forget gradients as well. Send the output to summaries/. 
You can use the function make_writer in the toy_modules.utils.
- Find the bugs that affect learning:
    - For each bug found create a new tensorboard directory to compare results. 
    (Example: found bug X --> TB output goes into summaries/bug_X)
